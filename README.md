# Club Penguin Back / Desktop
This is a work in progress Desktop client for Club Penguin Back

# Tester/End User instructions
Either get the EXE file from [Releases](https://github.com/cpback/desktop/releases) and run it, or get an [AppVeyor build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/daniel11420/backdesktop/build/artifacts) for the latest bugfixes and stuff (use AppVeyor if you're testing and Releases if you're just using it)

# Development instructions
`git clone` the repo into a folder, navigate into it and run `npm install`. To run the client, run `npm start`. (this requires nodejs and NPM). To build, run `npm run-script build` or `npm run-script build-mac`. (the latter requires you to be on a mac).
